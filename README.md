The repository contains Google Colab notebooks used in the analysis of two bibliographic datasets, one extracted from the 'Second Bibliography of Literature on Agricultural Meteorology' (British Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, 1936) and the other from the Bibliography of Agricultural Meteorology edited by Jen Yu Wang and Gerald L. Barger (The University of Wisconsin Press, 1962). Python libraries used in the notebooks: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, gensim, spacy. Data are extracted from a Zotero Library database (https://www.zotero.org) and imported as csv files. The code is potentially re-usable for analysis of other bibliographic data saved in Zotero. Code re-use with attribution is encouraged.
The data analysis has been used in the preparation of an advanced review for the journal WIREs Climate Change. The data analysis work has been made possible with funding provided by the German Research Foundation (DFG), project No. 321660352 (https://agriculturalmeteorology.wordpress.com).
